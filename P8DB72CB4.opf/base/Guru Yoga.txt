by Sera Khandro

Generate renunciation, bodhicitta, and a mind of aspiration.Then, with faith, intense longing
and fervent devotion,Visualize the guru at your crown and recite the following:
rang dün gyi namkhé chiwo ru
In the sky before me and above my head,
yi depé gesar shyepé teng
Upon the blossoming lotus of my devoted mind,
ma yeshe tsogyal namrol gar
Is the manifestation of mother Yeshe Tsogyal,
kyab kündü sukha benza tsal
Sukha Vajra Tsal, who embodies every form of refuge—
dü dralmé takpar shyuk né kyang
Remain constantly without ever parting,
dak go sum dorjé sum du lob
And bless my three doors as the three vajras!
kyé, ma yeshe khandro khyé khyen no
Kyé! Mother, wisdom ḍākinī, care for me!
chö kün gyi nyingpo dzogpa ché
Grant your blessings so that I may find freedom here and now
dön manor ösal rigpé né
In the great unborn and primordially pure ground,
sem trulpé drimé ma lepar
Untainted by the stains of a deluded mind—
shyi kadak kyemé chenpo ru
The key point of clear light awareness, which is the unerring meaning
dü danta drolwar jingyi lob
Of the Great Perfection, the essence of all phenomena.
gön khyé kyi tuk dang yermé par
Inseparable from your wisdom mind, O Protectress,
wang jinlab chikchar tob né kyang
May I instantly obtain your empowerment and blessing
tsé di la dön nyi pal tob shok
And gain the glory of twofold benefit in this very lifetime!
kaya waka tsitta sarwa siddhi pala hung ah
kāya vāk citta sarva siddhi phala hūṃ āḥ
Recite this and rest in the uncontrived space of suchness. Samaya. Gya. Gya. Gya.

Merely to avoid turning down the authoritative request of the noble being Rigdzin, who presented
me with sweet-scented incense and a divine silk scarf and expressed the need for just
such a text, I, Kunzang Chönyi Dechen Wangmo, composed this as the display of awareness from
the casket of awareness. Virtue! Virtue! Virtue!
